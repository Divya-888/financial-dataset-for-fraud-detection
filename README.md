## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains **financial transaction logs** and is inspired by [Kaggle's Synthetic Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).  
It includes over 6 million records with the following key fields:

| Column Name        | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `step`             | Time step (hour)                             |
| `type`             | Type of transaction (e.g. CASH_OUT, TRANSFER)|
| `amount`           | Transaction amount                           |
| `nameOrig`         | Customer ID of sender                        |
| `oldbalanceOrg`    | Sender balance before transaction            |
| `newbalanceOrig`   | Sender balance after transaction             |
| `nameDest`         | Receiver ID                                  |
| `oldbalanceDest`   | Receiver balance before transaction          |
| `newbalanceDest`   | Receiver balance after transaction           |
| `isFraud`          | 1 if transaction is fraudulent, else 0       |
| `isFlaggedFraud`   | 1 if system flagged as fraud, else 0         |

## üß™ Project Tasks

‚úî Wrote and ran **20 real-world SQL queries** grouped into key learning areas:

| Slide | Focus Area               | Example Queries                                 |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Basic Querying           | Count transactions, Top 10 CASH_OUT             |
| 2     | Aggregation              | Total & average by type                         |
| 3     | Filtering & Conditions   | High-value transactions, conditional checks     |
| 4     | Fraud Insights           | Flagged fraud, pattern detection                |
| 5     | Grouping & HAVING        | Sender behavior, frequency counts               |
| 6     | Window Functions         | RANK, Running totals                            |
| 7     | Subqueries & CASE        | Top senders, Categorize amounts                 |
| 8     | Joins & Data Checks      | Join with user tables, balance mismatches       |
